Adaptive Ensemble Machine Learning Models for Intrusion Detection


This project implements an adaptive ensemble of machine learning models to detect intrusions in a network. The primary goal is to classify network traffic as normal or malicious by combining multiple machine learning techniques to improve overall accuracy and robustness.

Project Overview
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are critical in protecting networks from malicious activities. This project utilizes multiple models combined in an ensemble approach to achieve high-performance intrusion detection. The ensemble includes models such as:

1)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

2)Random Forest
Each model's performance is evaluated using various metrics on training, validation, and test sets.

Key Features
Adaptive Ensemble: Combines multiple machine learning algorithms to optimize intrusion detection performance.

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for all datasets.

Data Processing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing for binary classification of network traffic into normal or malicious categories.


Installation:

Clone this repository:
bash

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git

Install the required dependencies:
bash

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the notebook or the Python script for training and evaluating the models. Ensure the dataset is available in the specified format.

Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Results

For the KNN model:

Training Accuracy: 99.25%

Validation Accuracy: 99.14%

Test Accuracy: 84.29%

These metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in detecting intrusions, with further tuning possible to improve test performance.

Future Improvements

Incorporate more advanced models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.

Experiment with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to further improve performance.
